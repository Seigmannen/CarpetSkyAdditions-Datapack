# CarpetSkyAdditions-Datapack

**Status:** In Development. Not ready for full useâ€”testing phase ongoing.

## Overview
The `CarpetSkyAdditions-Datapack` is a custom Minecraft datapack designed to complement the [CarpetSkyAdditions-Reborn](https://github.com/TreeOfSelf/CarpetSkyAdditions-Reborn) Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.1. It introduces several new mechanics and tweaks to enhance skyblock gameplay by adding unique features, advancements, and interactions not covered by the mod alone.

## Installation
1. Disable the built-in datapack in the `CarpetSkyAdditions-Reborn` mod.
2. Enable and install this datapack.

## Features & Changes
### Incomplete or Under Development:
- **Breeze Spawning Mechanism:** This datapack is working now. Build the breeze 3x3 floor structure, stand one block south from the floor structure, then use fint and steel on the middle copper block. The trial spawner will appear, with a vault and ominous vault close by. There are a few things that needs a little bit of tweaking, but it doesn't stop the datapack functioning.

### Implemented Features:
- **Renewable Swift Sneak:** Added a loot table for librarians to drop a Swift Sneak book (level 1-3) when killed by a Warden. Disable CarpetSkyAdditions-Reborn non working function: /carpetskyadditions removeDefault renewableSwiftSneak
- **Sniffer Sand/Gravel Conversion:** carpetskyadditions_reborn crashes the game; The datapack sniffer_digging is now working. Implementing the 10% chance for turning sand/gravel to the suspicous variant proved to be hard. Anyone have a solution for this?

- **Vex to Allay Transformation:** In carpetskyadditions_reborn vex to allay seems to be broken. Here is a different approach. Build the vex sacrificial structure, bring the vex to the top of the structure,on the glowstone in the middle, then stand on the chiseled copper block. Use a amethyst shard and hit the vex. If everything is ok, the vex will turn inta an allay. The structure is directional. The glowstone stairs need to point toward the south. When the player stand on the chiseled copper block and look at the vex, the player should be facing north.
