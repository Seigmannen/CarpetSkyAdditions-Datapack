# CarpetSkyAdditions-Datapack

**Status:** In Development. Not ready for full useâ€”testing phase ongoing.

## Overview
The `CarpetSkyAdditions-Datapack` is a custom Minecraft datapack designed to complement the [CarpetSkyAdditions-Reborn](https://github.com/TreeOfSelf/CarpetSkyAdditions-Reborn) Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.1. It introduces several new mechanics and tweaks to enhance skyblock gameplay by adding unique features, advancements, and interactions not covered by the mod alone.

## Installation
1. Disable the built-in datapack in the `CarpetSkyAdditions-Reborn` mod.
2. Enable and install this datapack.

## Features & Changes
### Incomplete or Under Development:
- **Vex to Allay Transformation:** Currently exploring alternative methods due to limitations.
- **Sniffer Sand/Gravel Conversion:** carpetskyadditions_reborn crashes the game; The datapack sniffer_digging is now working. What is left is binding the loot tables correctly. Right now there is one loot table for suspicious sand and one for suspicious gravel.
- **Wandering Trader Camel Riding:** carpetskyadditions_reborn crashes the game; relogs fix the issue, searching for a stable solution.
- **Breeze Spawning Mechanism:** Considering converting blazes into breezes and developing a custom structure-based spawner system.

### Implemented Features:
- **Renewable Swift Sneak:** Added a loot table for librarians to drop a Swift Sneak book (level 1-3) when killed by a Warden.
- **Modified Piglin Bartering:** Adjusted loot tables to ensure enchanted books from piglin bartering are only Soul Speed books (level 1-3).
- **Light Source Advancement:** Updated the light source achievement to include all copper bulb variants (67 total).
- **Spyglass all animals Advancement:** Included armadillos, raising the total number of animals to 40.
- **Spider Conversion Advancement:** Fixed the cave spider kill triggering issue for achievement.
- **Minor Script Fixes:** Adjusted scripts for stability and compatibility.

### New Additions:
- **Testing Functions:**
  - `remove_vaults`: Deletes blocks in a specific radius to aid in trial chamber testing.
- **Breeze Drops:** Added a chance for breezes to drop pottery sherds found in trial chambers.
- **Trial Chamber Music Disks:** Skeletons killing creepers in trial chambers' bounding boxes now drop three music disks.
- **Armor Trim Challenges:** Added challenges for obtaining the bolt and flow armor trim smithing templates.

## Notes
- This datapack includes manual functions and potential testing-only scripts that may not be suitable for regular gameplay yet.

## Future Work
Continued development and testing are ongoing to implement, refine, and stabilize all planned features.
