# CarpetSkyAdditions-Datapack

## Overview
The `CarpetSkyAdditions-Datapack` is a custom Minecraft datapack designed to complement the [CarpetSkyAdditions-Reborn](https://github.com/TreeOfSelf/CarpetSkyAdditions-Reborn) Fabric mod. It introduces several new mechanics and tweaks to enhance skyblock gameplay by adding unique features, advancements, and interactions not covered by the mod alone.

## Installation
1. Disable the built-in datapack in the `CarpetSkyAdditions-Reborn` mod.
2. Enable and install this datapack.

### Implemented Features:

- **Skyblock Datapack:** This datapack starts with an oak tree.

- **Skyblock Datapack MMH:** This version includes an edited version of the Vanilla Tweaks More Mob Heads.
  
- **Skyblock Acacia Datapack:** This datapack will start with an acacia tree for a little harder game.

- **Skyblock Acacia Datapack MMH:** This version includes an edited version of the Vanilla Tweaks More Mob Heads.

- **Skyblock No Tree:** This datapack starts without any tree.

- **Skyblock No Tree MMH:** This version includes an edited version of the Vanilla Tweaks More Mob Heads.

- **Skyblock No Tree CSAR:** This datapack starts without any tree, and does not feature any other custom additions. It behaves the same way as the CarpetSkyAdditions-Reborn datapack.

- **Standalone Datapacks:** In the original mod, both datapacks needed to be selected for skyblock acacia to have all advancements/behaviors. This version is standalone. No need to activate both datapacks.

### New Additions:

- **Armor Trim Challenges:** Added challenges for obtaining the bolt and flow armor trim smithing templates.

- **Trial Chamber Music Disks:** Skeletons killing creepers in trial chambers' bounding boxes now has a chance to drop two of the music disks related to trial chambers.

- **Trial Chamber Music Disks Advancement:** Added new advancement for getting music disks from trial chambers using creepers.

- **Updated Loot Table for Trial Vaults:** These are too overpowered, so they have been nerfed.

- **More Mob Heads:** Added an edited version of Vanilla Tweaks More Mob Heads Datapack to make it work with the mod.
